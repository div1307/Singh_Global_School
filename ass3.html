            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>History and Vision of Singh's Global School</h3>
            <p>Welcome! Singh's Global School has been featuring among the top 10 schools of East Delhi and top 20 schools of Delhi for the last 5 years (2019-2024). It provides education to the students from classes Nursery to 12th (all streams - Science, Commerce, Humanities). It was established in the year 1995 by the present Chairman Mr. Kulwinder Singh in Mayur Vihar, Delhi-91. His vision remains the same ,which is reflected in the school's logo 'Little hands with their green acts to make this earth a better place to live'. He wanted to provide quality education to students to build a better future both for themselves and the Earth and continues to succeed in his imagined vision with over 3000 students and a faculty of over 100 selectively chosen teachers. He began the school in tents and now has managed to develop a 5000 sq. yards 4-storey building with a playground, lawn tennis court, skating ring, swimming pool, adventure swings, amphitheatre, pedestrian path and most importantly a variety of flora spread across it. The school has also had some remarkable innings in the past few years including the International School Award 2020-23 and Green Leaf Award by Centre for Science & Environment.</p>
